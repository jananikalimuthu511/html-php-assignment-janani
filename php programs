2. Create a PHP program to display the division table using for-loop.
1 2 3
1 1 0.5 0.33
2 2 1 0.66
3 3 1.5 1
Answer:
<?php
echo "  1 2 3\n";
for ($i = 1; $i <= 3; $i++) {
    echo $i . " ";
    for ($j = 1; $j <= 3; $j++) {
        $result = $i / $j;
        echo round($result, 2) . " ";
    }
    echo "\n";
}
?>

4.Predict the output of the following snippet:
$animal = “antelope”; $animal_heads = 1; $animal_legs = 4;
echo“The $animal has $animal_heads head(s).”;
echo“The $animal has $animal_legs leg(s).”;

 Output:The antelope has 1 head(s).The antelope has 4 leg(s).

5. You are building a website where users can calculate the total cost of their purchases.
Write a PHP program that takes the price and quantity of three items from the user and
calculates the subtotal, tax (10% of the subtotal),and the total cost (subtotal + tax).
Display the results to the user.

Code:
<?php
$price1 = 100;
$qty1   = 2;

$price2 = 50;
$qty2   = 3;

$price3 = 20;
$qty3   = 5;

$subtotal = ($price1 * $qty1) + ($price2 * $qty2) + ($price3 * $qty3);
$tax = $subtotal * 0.10;
$total = $subtotal + $tax;

Output:
Subtotal: Rs. 450
Tax (10%): Rs. 45
Total: Rs. 495

7.Create a form which takes the name of the user as input and prints a greeting in the format

8. A customer visits a shop to buy a soft drink; he has two options:
Drink A cost is Rs.25 and the size of the bottle is 11.
Drink B cost is Rs.23 and its size of the bottle is 9.
Which drink should he choose to save money? Solve this problem using function deal ( ).

Code:
<?php
function deal() {
    
    $costA = 25;
    $sizeA = 11;
    $valueA = $costA / $sizeA;  // Cost per unit

    $costB = 23;
    $sizeB = 9;
    $valueB = $costB / $sizeB;  // Cost per unit

    if ($valueA < $valueB) {
        echo "Choose Drink A to save money.\n";
    } elseif ($valueB < $valueA) {
        echo "Choose Drink B to save money.\n";
    } else {
        echo "Both drinks offer the same value.\n";
    }
}

deal();
?>

Output:
Choose Drink A to save money.

9. Predict the output of the following snippet:
$this = “this”; $that = “that”; $the_other = 2.2000000000;

Output:this,,that+2.2

10. Develop a program to check student grades based on marks using a loop.

Code:
<?php
$number_of_students = 3;

for ($i = 1; $i <= $number_of_students; $i++) {
    echo "Enter marks for student $i (0-100): ";
    $marks = trim(fgets(STDIN));

    if (!is_numeric($marks) || $marks < 0 || $marks > 100) {
        echo "Invalid marks entered. Please enter a number between 0 and 100.\n";
        continue; 
    }

    if ($marks >= 90) {
        $grade = "A";
    } elseif ($marks >= 80) {
        $grade = "B";
    } elseif ($marks >= 70) {
        $grade = "C";
    } elseif ($marks >= 60) {
        $grade = "D";
    } else {
        $grade = "F";
    }

    echo "Student $i Grade: $grade\n";
}
?>

Output:
Enter marks for student 1 (0-100): 95
Student 1 Grade: A

Code:
<?php
echo "Enter a number (1 to 7) to get the day of the week: ";

switch ($day_number) {
    case 1:
        echo "Monday\n";

12. Write a program to check student grade based on marks:
Conditions:
If marks are 75% or more, the grade will be First Class.
If marks between 60% to 74%, grade will be second class.
If marks between 40% to 59%, grade will be third class.
If marks are less than 40%, students will be Fail.

Code:
<?php
echo "Enter student's marks (in percentage): ";
$marks = trim(fgets(STDIN));

if (!is_numeric($marks) || $marks < 0 || $marks > 100) {
    echo "Invalid input. Please enter a number between 0 and 100.\n";
} else {
    if ($marks >= 75) {
        echo "Grade: First Class\n";
    } elseif ($marks >= 60) {
        echo "Grade: Second Class\n";
    } elseif ($marks >= 40) {
        echo "Grade: Third Class\n";
    } else {
        echo "Grade: Fail\n";
    }
}
?>

Output:
