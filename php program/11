11. Develop a PHP program to show days of the week using switch cases.

Code:
<?php
echo "Enter a number (1 to 7) to get the day of the week: ";
$day_number = trim(fgets(STDIN));

switch ($day_number) {
    case 1:
        echo "Monday\n";
        break;
    case 2:
        echo "Tuesday\n";
        break;
    case 3:
        echo "Wednesday\n";
        break;
    case 4:
        echo "Thursday\n";
        break;
    case 5:
        echo "Friday\n";
        break;
    case 6:
        echo "Saturday\n";
        break;
    case 7:
        echo "Sunday\n";
        break;
    default:
        echo "Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 7.\n";
        break;
}
?>

Output: 
Enter a number (1 to 7) to get the day of the week: 1
Monday
