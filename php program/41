41) How can you use regular expressions to extract all email addresses from a given string using an array in
PHP?
<?php
$text = "Contact us at support@example.com, sales@shop.org or admin123@test.co.in for details.";
$pattern = "/[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,}/";
preg_match_all($pattern, $text, $matches);
$emails = $matches[0];
echo "Extracted Email Addresses:<br>";
foreach ($emails as $email) {
    echo $email . "<br>";
}
?>
OUTPUT:
Extracted Email Addresses:
support@example.com
sales@shop.org
admin123@test.co.in
