22. Create a PHP script that counts the number of occurrences of a specific word in a given
string.

Code:
<?php
$text = "PHP is easy. PHP is powerful. I love PHP!";
$word = "PHP";

$count = substr_count($text, $word);

echo "The word '$word' appears $count times in the string.";
?>

Output:
The word 'PHP' appears 3 times in the string.
