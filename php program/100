100. Using PHP, construct a program to restrict the user from uploading the same file again and again. If the same file already exists in that folder, display an appropriate error message.
<?php
if(isset($_FILES['file'])){
    $filename = $_FILES['file']['name'];
    $target = "uploads/" . $filename;

    if(file_exists($target)){
        echo "Error: The file '$filename' already exists!";
    } else {
        move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $target);
        echo "File uploaded successfully.";
    }
}
?>

<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    Choose File: <input type="file" name="file">
    <input type="submit" value="Upload">
</form>
