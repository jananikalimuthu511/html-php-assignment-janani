12. Write a program to check student grade based on marks:
Conditions:
If marks are 75% or more, the grade will be First Class.
If marks between 60% to 74%, grade will be second class.
If marks between 40% to 59%, grade will be third class.
If marks are less than 40%, students will be Fail.

Code:
<?php
echo "Enter student's marks (in percentage): ";
$marks = trim(fgets(STDIN));

if (!is_numeric($marks) || $marks < 0 || $marks > 100) {
    echo "Invalid input. Please enter a number between 0 and 100.\n";
} else {
    if ($marks >= 75) {
        echo "Grade: First Class\n";
    } elseif ($marks >= 60) {
        echo "Grade: Second Class\n";
    } elseif ($marks >= 40) {
        echo "Grade: Third Class\n";
    } else {
        echo "Grade: Fail\n";
    }
}
?>

Output:
Enter student's marks (in percentage): 82
Grade: First Class
