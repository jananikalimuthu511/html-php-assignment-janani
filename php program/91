91. Recognize how sessions are stored in PHP?
<?php
/*
Sessions in PHP are stored on the server.
- By default, session data is stored in temporary files on the server (e.g., /tmp folder).
- Each session has a unique session ID.
- The session ID is stored on the client side as a cookie (PHPSESSID).
- The server uses this ID to match and retrieve session data.
*/
echo "Sessions are stored on the server with a unique session ID linked via PHPSESSID cookie.";
?>
