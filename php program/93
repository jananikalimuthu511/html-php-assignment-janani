93. Write a PHP program that keeps track of how many times a visitor has loaded the page.
<?php
session_start();

if(isset($_SESSION['views'])){
    $_SESSION['views'] = $_SESSION['views'] + 1;
} else {
    $_SESSION['views'] = 1;
}

echo "You have visited this page " . $_SESSION['views'] . " times.";
?>
