39) A school wants to automate the calculation of student grades. Design a system that allows teachers to input
student scores, calculates their grades, and generates a summary report. How would you utilize arrays and
array functions to store and process the student data effectively?
<?php
$students = array(
    "Alice" => 85,
    "Bob" => 72,
    "Charlie" => 90,
    "David" => 65,
    "Eva" => 50
);
function getGrade($score) {
    if ($score >= 90) return "A";
    elseif ($score >= 80) return "B";
    elseif ($score >= 70) return "C";
    elseif ($score >= 60) return "D";
    else return "F";
}
echo "<h3>Student Grade Report</h3>";
foreach ($students as $name => $score) {
    $grade = getGrade($score);
    echo "$name - Score: $score - Grade: $grade <br>";
}
$totalStudents = count($students);
$totalScore = array_sum($students);
$average = $totalScore / $totalStudents;
$highest = max($students);
$lowest = min($students);
$topper = array_keys($students, $highest);

echo "<h3>Summary</h3>";
echo "Total Students: $totalStudents <br>";
echo "Average Score: $average <br>";
echo "Highest Score: $highest (Topper: " . implode(", ", $topper) . ")<br>";
echo "Lowest Score: $lowest <br>";
?>
OUTPUT:
Student Grade Report
Alice - Score: 85 - Grade: B 
Bob - Score: 72 - Grade: C 
Charlie - Score: 90 - Grade: A 
David - Score: 65 - Grade: D 
Eva - Score: 50 - Grade: F 

Summary
Total Students: 5 
Average Score: 72.4 
Highest Score: 90 (Topper: Charlie)
Lowest Score: 50
