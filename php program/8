Drink A cost is Rs.25 and the size of the bottle is 11.
Drink B cost is Rs.23 and its size of the bottle is 9.

<?php
function deal() {
    
    $costA = 25;
    $sizeA = 11;
    $valueA = $costA / $sizeA;  

    $costB = 23;
    $sizeB = 9;
    $valueB = $costB / $sizeB;  

    if ($valueA < $valueB) {
        echo "Choose Drink A to save money.\n";
    } elseif ($valueB < $valueA) {
        echo "Choose Drink B to save money.\n";
    } else {
        echo "Both drinks offer the same value.\n";
    }
}

deal();
?>
