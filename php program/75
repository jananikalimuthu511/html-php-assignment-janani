75. Build a PHP function that takes the filename and a new line of content as input. Append the new line of content as a new line at the end of the file.
<?php
function appendToFile($filename, $newline){
    $file = fopen($filename, "a"); // open in append mode
    fwrite($file, $newline . "\n");
    fclose($file);
    echo "Line appended successfully!";
}

// Example call
appendToFile("demo.txt", "This is a new appended line.");
?>
