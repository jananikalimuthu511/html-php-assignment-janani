76. Write a simple 'birthday countdown' script, the script will count the number of days between current day and birthday.
<?php
$today = strtotime(date("Y-m-d"));
$birthday = strtotime("2025-12-25"); // change date to your birthday

$diff = $birthday - $today;
$days = ceil($diff / (60 * 60 * 24));

if($days > 0){
    echo "Your birthday is in $days days!";
} elseif($days == 0){
    echo "Happy Birthday!";
} else {
    echo "Your birthday has passed this year.";
}
?>
