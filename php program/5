5. You are building a website where users can calculate the total cost of their purchases.
Write a PHP program that takes the price and quantity of three items from the user and
calculates the subtotal, tax (10% of the subtotal),and the total cost (subtotal + tax).
Display the results to the user.

Code:
<?php
$price1 = 100;
$qty1   = 2;

$price2 = 50;
$qty2   = 3;

$price3 = 20;
$qty3   = 5;

$subtotal = ($price1 * $qty1) + ($price2 * $qty2) + ($price3 * $qty3);
$tax = $subtotal * 0.10;
$total = $subtotal + $tax;

Output:
Subtotal: Rs. 450
Tax (10%): Rs. 45
Total: Rs. 495
